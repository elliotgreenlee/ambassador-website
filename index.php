			<p>The University of Tennessee College of Engineering Ambassadors program was
			founded in 2004. The Ambassadors are the undergraduate arm of
			recruitment for the college. However, the scope of the program has been
			continuously expanding to meet the college&rsquo;s needs.</p>

			<p>The purpose of the Ambassadors is to recruit prospective students to
			the College of Engineering, involve the college&rsquo;s student body in its
			goals, and stimulate community interest in the field of engineering.</p>

			<p>We are pleased to welcome you to the Ambassadors website. Feel free
			to contact us to request a campus tour, learn more about the college or
			university as a whole, or simply discuss engineering as a potential
			career.</p>

			<p>We look forward to hearing from you! </p>
