	<h1>College Life </h1>
  <p>Engineering students spend lots of time in lectures and labs requiring focus, time commitment and hard work. 
    Depending on how much you want to succeed depends on how much time you spend outside the classroom studying. 
    Good time management skills will help you to achieve academic goals, while still enjoying the college experience.

    Freshman students who are not living with a parent or guardian are required to live in university housing 
    during their first year of college. The College of Engineering offers an optional housing program for freshmen 
    known as the <a href="http://housing.utk.edu/llc/communities/engage/" target="_blank">Engage Learning Community</a>. 
    This community gives you the opportunity to live in the same residence hall  close to other first-year engineering 
    students. Since you  will be taking  common classes with your neighbors,  it is easier to share notes, form 
    study groups and  develop a sense of camaraderie. You can find more information on  residence halls at the 
    <a href="http://uthousing.utk.edu/" target="_blank">UT Housing website</a>.
